      <h3>TeamTracker</h3>
      <p>
        Getting insight about the activity of multiple software teams within an organization can be a hard and time demanding task. TeamTracker currently integrates with tools like GitHub and Slack to get information about how your staff communicates, how projects are progressing and how work is being done across multiple teams. TeamTracker can be used by all kinds of software development groups including companies, open source teams and even students in the classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        TeamTracker consists of a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webservice">Web Service</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webapp">Web App</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-frontend">Front-end shell</a>. There's still a lot of work to do and the project has a great potencial for more integrations. Feel free to contribute!

      <h3>Software Engineering Education: Current Practices and Tool Support</h3>
      <p>
        Communication, collaboration and coordination are essential aspects in software development teams. Developers use many tools to manage their interactions and activities, and to facilitate collaboration within and across development teams. This research proposes to investigate current collaboration practices in the classroom for a Software Engineering undergraduate course at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Through interviews with professors, the research aims to report how projects occur and what are the difficulties faced in conducting projects. Our analysis aims at informing the design of new tools, methods and techniques for conducting and evaluating projects in Software Engineering courses and educational mechanisms that encourage greater participation and collaboration among students.

      <h3>An investigation about remote pair programming</h3>
      <p>
        Pair programming is an Extreme Programming practice where two programmers work together on a single machine aiming to produce a software artifact. As the world gets even more globalized, pair programming has started being used in a remote context. So, there is a need to investigate how it can be effectively adopted in a distributed scenario, as well as to identify the challenges faced by developers under these conditions. For this investigation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews are being conducted and results analyzed following a qualitative approach based on Grounded Theory. Once the difficulties are well understood, this study plans to explore and propose potential solutions that mitigate the identified problems.
