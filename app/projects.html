      <h2>TeamTracker</h2>
      <p>
        Getting knowledge about how a software team cooperates and interacts is a hard and time demanding task. Data is spread across a lot of places and some habits are hard to track. TeamTracker plans to integrate with tools like GitHub and Slack to get information about how does your staff communicates, how your projects are progressing and and how useful a teammate's work is being to the team. It also aims to improve the way knowledge is spread across your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        TeamTracker can be used by all kinds of software development groups like class students working on a course project, enterprises and even open source teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        It consists in a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webservice">Web Service</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webapp">Web App</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-frontend">Front-end shell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's still a lot of work to do and the project has a great potencial for more integrations. Feel free to contribute!

      <h2>The perspective of teachers about practices and tools for project development in Software Engineering classroom</h2>
      <p>
        Communication, collaboration and coordination are essential aspects in software development teams. Developers use many tools to manage their interactions and activities, and to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of the same team. The recent adoption of new social media by developers provides opportunities for reflection on new approaches to teaching Software Engineering, and to the creation of new tools to support projects in disciplines. In this context, practical projects in software engineering course promote the insertion of these tools in the classroom, and also approximates the student of a real development environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This research proposes to investigate the development of practical projects in the classroom for teaching Software Engineering. Through interviews with teachers, the research aims to report how projects occur and what are the difficulties encountered in conducting projects in Software Engineering courses. The interview analysis aims to inform the design of new tools through the Requirements Elicitation, but also methods and techniques for conducting and evaluating projects in Software Engineering courses and educational mechanisms that encourage greater participation of students during projects.
