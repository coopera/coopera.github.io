      <h3>TeamTracker</h3>
      <p>
        Getting insight about the activity of multiple software teams within an organization can be a hard and time demanding task. TeamTracker currently integrates with tools like GitHub and Slack to get information about how your staff communicates, how projects are progressing and how work is being done across multiple teams. TeamTracker can be used by all kinds of software development groups including companies, open source teams and even students in the classroom.

        Curious? You can check our <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker">repository</a>! There's still a lot of work to do and the project has a great potencial for more integrations. Feel free to contribute!

      <h3>Software Engineering Education: Current Practices and Tool Support</h3>
      <p>
        Communication, collaboration and coordination are essential aspects in software development teams. Developers use many tools to manage their interactions and activities, and to facilitate collaboration within and across development teams. This research proposes to investigate current collaboration practices in the classroom for a Software Engineering undergraduate course at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Through interviews with professors, the research aims to report how projects occur and what are the difficulties faced in conducting projects. Our analysis aims at informing the design of new tools, methods and techniques for conducting and evaluating projects in Software Engineering courses and educational mechanisms that encourage greater participation and collaboration among students.

      <h3>An Automatic Approach to Detect and Notify Development Teams of Unusual Events in Software Repositories</h3>
      <p>
       Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is an area that focuses on investigating and analyzing
projects, products, and people in the context of software development by inspecting
Software Repositories. The results of such analysis can help managers and developers to
better understand their product, team dynamics and software process, which can also
help plan the cost and time of future releases. Awareness, which can be defined as “an
understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity”,
is a commonly approached topic in work in the MSR area. Awareness involves knowing
who is around, what activities are occurring, who is talking with whom; it provides a view
of one another in the daily work environments. This work aims to increase awareness in
software development teams by investigating unusual events, which are events that are not
in conformance with normality. This thesis presents a mechanism to automatically detect
unusual events in software repositories, as well as to make managers and developers aware
of them. Towards this purpose, we developed a project called UEMiner with the following
main objectives: (i) to collect data from source code repositories; (ii) to store this data
allowing it to be retrieved and prepared for further analysis; (iii) to analyze data, in order
to identify unusual events. In order to determine what is normal in the context of software
development teams and projects, we gather historical data from software repositories, at
the current step commit-related data, to investigate unusual events. To test and validate
our proposal, we present a case study that uses data from the academic system (SIGAA)
of UFRN developed by Superintendência de Informática (SINFO)/UFRN. When we presented
a list of unusual events detected by our approach to six developers at SINFO, they
confirmed the usefulness of the approach and we found that the commits detected by our
approach often corresponded to events that the developers perceived to be unusual. These
results indicate that awareness of unusual events can play an important role in collaborative
software development, and that automated mining software repository approaches
can be used for the detection of these events.
