      <h2>TeamTracker</h2>  
      <p>
        Getting knowledge about how a software team cooperates and interacts is a hard and time demanding task. Data is spread across a lot of places and some habits are hard to track. TeamTracker plans to integrate with tools like GitHub and Slack to get information about how does your staff comunicates, how your projects are progressing and and how useful a teammate's work is being to the team. It also aims to improve the way knowledge is spread across your team.     
      </p>
      <p>
        TeamTracker can be used by all kinds of software development groups like class students working on a course project, enterprises and even open source teams. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It consists in a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webservice">Web Service</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webapp">Web App</a and a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-frontend">Front-end shell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's still a lot of work to do and the project has a great potencial for more integrations. Feel free to contribute!
