      <h3>TeamTracker</h3>
      <p>
        Getting knowledge about how a software team cooperates and interacts is a hard and time demanding task. Data is spread across a lot of places and some habits are hard to track. TeamTracker plans to integrate with tools like GitHub and Slack to get information about how does your staff communicates, how your projects are progressing and and how useful a teammate's work is being to the team. It also aims to improve the way knowledge is spread across your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        TeamTracker can be used by all kinds of software development groups like class students working on a course project, enterprises and even open source teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        It consists in a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webservice">Web Service</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-webapp">Web App</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/coopera/teamtracker-frontend">Front-end shell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's still a lot of work to do and the project has a great potencial for more integrations. Feel free to contribute!

      <h3>Software Engineering Education: Current Practices and Tool Support</h3>
      <p>
        Communication, collaboration and coordination are essential aspects in software development teams. Developers use many tools to manage their interactions and activities, and to facilitate collaboration within and across development teams. This research proposes to investigate current collaboration practices in the classroom for a Software Engineering undergraduate course at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Through interviews with professors, the research aims to report how projects occur and what are the difficulties faced in conducting projects. Our analysis aims at informing the design of new tools, methods and techniques for conducting and evaluating projects in Software Engineering courses and educational mechanisms that encourage greater participation and collaboration among students.
