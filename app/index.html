      We are an interdisciplinary group of researchers seeking to find implications for the design of software that empowers people to cooperate more effectively and creatively. <br><br>
      Our research interests include computer supported cooperative work, social informatics, global software development, OSS communities, web technologies, social media, software engineering education, among others.<br><br>
      We work as a development team and strive to be as open as possible to new ideas. We are located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natal,_Rio_Grande_do_Norte">Natal</a>, a beautiful city in the northeast of Brazil. We'll be delighted to have you visiting!
